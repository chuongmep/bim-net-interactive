# NET Interactive Revit Kernel
**Bringing Literal Programming to Autodesk Revit**

## Background

Polyglot notebooks has been gaining popularity recent years with Jupyter at the forefront. In 2022, Mirosoft introduced Polyglot Notebooks (former .NET Interactive Notebooks), an extension to Visual Studio Code that allows developers run multi-language.

It allows developers and researchers to combine text and live code in a narrative - a sort of Literate Programming. As Donald Knuth puts it in his 1984 paper: *"The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce each other."* They allow users to work with different programming languages in a single environment, reducing the need to switch between multiple tools which save time and increase productivity, particularly for tasks that involve multiple programming languages or libraries. They also allows users to document their work in a more interactive and engaging way.

## Problems
The polygot programmer recognize that different languages have different strengths and various access to library. Python is very common in the academia while languages such as C# and Java in the industry sector.
